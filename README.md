> My Project helps to identify the variables that are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and how well those variables describe the bike demand.

## General Information

- The dataset pertains to BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing company that has experienced significant declines in revenue as a result of the ongoing Corona pandemic. The current state of the market is making it extremely difficult for the company to survive. It has therefore made the conscious decision to develop a thoughtful business plan in order to boost its income as soon as the current lockdown ends and the economy recovers to a sound state.
- The variables influencing the demand for the bikes have been identified through the application of linear regression.
- Two models have been constructed. The'mnth' variable in the first model is encoded to dummy variables, and the 'qrtr' variable in the second model is derived from the'mnth' variable.

## Conclusions

- Top 3 features that has significant impact towards explaining the demand of the shared
  bikes are temperature, year, and season.

## Technologies Used

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- statsmodels
- sklearn
- calendar
